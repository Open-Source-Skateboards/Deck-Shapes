Skateboard deck shapes

Skateboard deck shapes will be shared here in editable formats (DXF).

NAMING CONVENTION: Skateboard shapes are tricky to identify with keyboard buttons. So, the naming convention is WIDTH_WHEELBASE_NOSE LENGTH_TAIL LENGTH. Decimals are represented by a "-" instead of ".".  For example, an 8.25" wide board with a 14" wheelbase, 6.75" nose and 6.5" tail would be written as:
8-25_14_6-75_6-5. PDFs are uploaded so you can quickly browse through designs.

Note: these are deck profiles, only (no mold data is captured by these DXFs). DXFs are provided since they are a common vector format usable by CNC tools (routers, lasers, etc.) and can be printed full scale for paper templates.

ADVANCED: To fully design/model your board, you can use this tool: http://bit.ly/SVG2JSCAD - instructions are there. It's not super easy, it may not even work... but if it does it's kind of fun and useful.
